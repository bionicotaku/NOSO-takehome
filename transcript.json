And the only thing I just want to make sure is clear. It on my end it would be so much easier if I didn't have to charge for the repair today. And if we actually just basically considered it as a complimentary thing for you. So if we did feel comfortable with signing, what that would just look like on your end would just be a $1000 down payment. Um, the other thing is we can see what options you qualify for in regards to financing. And if that's the case, if we have financing, then I don't even need a down payment today. We would just do just the financing side of it. And we do come with a—every contractor that's reputable comes with this guarantee here. So as you're talking to your wife, if anything weird comes up we even have this notice right here. So we always have a reputable 3 day right to cancel. So."

So um I'm going to pretty these estimates up a little bit more and I'll include the duct sealing promotion. And because TECH is uh needing a HERS test, we actually just kind of have to do that anyways. So I'm I'm going to uh modify it a little bit. And what you'll see that's new when I send it to you is Permit and HERS test. You'll see a duct seal cost but then if you keep scrolling down you would see a uh it credited back as the promotion.
