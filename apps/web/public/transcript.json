We would just do just the financing side of it. And we do come with a—every contractor that's reputable comes with this guarantee here.

Although the technician offered to waive the day's repair fee if a replacement contract was signed immediately, the homeowner declined the immediate offer, paid for the repair, and requested the heat pump estimates be emailed for further discussion with his wife."
