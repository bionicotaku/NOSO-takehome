He presented detailed comparisons between a standard gas furnace replacement and high-efficiency heat pump upgrades (specifically Bryant and Bosch models), highlighting California-specific rebates (SVCE and TECH) and addressing the homeowner’s concerns regarding system noise and outdoor venting direction. Although the technician offered to waive the day's repair fee if a replacement contract was signed immediately, the homeowner declined the immediate offer, paid for the repair, and requested the heat pump estimates be emailed for further discussion with his wife."
